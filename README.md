## Help Me Speach :speech_balloon:

*Activities involving speaches, such as, presenting a speach, public speaking, acting in a play, or even being interviewed, can sometimes be nerve-wracking. 
That is, if you're **unprepared**. 
Help Me Speach will help you practice, and prepare you to ace your script!*  

### What is "Help Me Speach" ?
Help Me Speach is an app (or a website) that aims to help people practice their speaches, in forms of scripts, which are so called a "writing". The genesis behind this idea comes from a common issue which many people and I encounter, speaking. It might seem pointless to help people "speak" as that is a natural way for people to communicate. However, in occasions such as giving an acceptance speach, presenting an idea to a client, reading a monologue infront of a crowd, or being interviewed for a job, as the tensions rise from the pressure given by the crowd or by the fear of forgetting what to say, (etc.), speaking can get tough. 
Hence, to help people prepare for their speaking or speaches, Help Me Speach probides features that could help them practice with their scripts!
