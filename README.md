## [Help Me Speech :speech_balloon:](https://help-me-speech.netlify.app/)

*Activities involving speaches, such as, presenting a speach, public speaking, acting in a play, or even being interviewed, can sometimes be nerve-wracking. 
That is, if you're **unprepared**. 
Help Me Speach will help you practice, and prepare you to ace your script!*  

### What is "Help Me Speech" ?
Help Me Speach is an app (or a website) that aims to help people practice their speaches, in forms of scripts, which are so called a "writing". The genesis behind this idea comes from a common issue which many people and I encounter, speaking. It might seem pointless to help people "speak" as that is a natural way for people to communicate. However, in occasions such as giving an acceptance speach, presenting an idea to a client, reading a monologue infront of a crowd, or being interviewed for a job, as the tensions rise from the pressure given by the crowd or by the fear of forgetting what to say, (etc.), speaking can get tough. 
Hence, for people to prepare their speaking or speaches, Help Me Speach provides features that could help them practice with their scripts!

### Goals
There are several goals behind this project. Firstly is to apply all of my knowledge gained from the Codaisseur Academy 11-weeks FullStack development course into practice. Second is to apply new tools and learn independently on how to use them in practice. And lastly, ofcource, is to create an app or website that will be used for people to practice their speaches. The following shows the details:
- Create independent app with precious knwoledge, i.e. react and redux as FE, and sequelize ORM and express as BE
- Learn and use new tools such as TypeScript, Cloudinary, and to a further extent Bootstrap
- Create own web design and data framework
- Learn the full-process of creating a plan, complete from the GitHub commits, merges, push, and pulls, o the netlify and heroku deployments
